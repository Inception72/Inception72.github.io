# About Me
I enjoy working out and reading for the most part. Between school and work requirements I don't have a lot of time to expand on my hobbies. I enjoy reading philosophy books, especially the Russian authors. Sometimes I will take the time to read fantasy if I am in the mood. Other authors include James Patterson, Dean Koontz, Steven King, etc.

I find attachment Theory interesting because it allows for a roadmap to how we interact with anyone. This roadmap is setup unconsciously when you are a child and heavy dependent on your personality and the choices or reactions your parents give you. Developmental psychology is interesting to see how small memories from your childhood can have life long lasting effects.
